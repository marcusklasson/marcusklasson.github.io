This is my first post.

{% highlight ruby %}
print('Hallow world!')
#=> prints 'Hallow world!'.
{% endhighlight %}

Furthermore, I got vaccinated with my first dose of pfizer today.

Now I will have to wait for 7 weeks until I can book a time slot to get the second dose. Makes me think of the Prince song '7':

*All 7 we'll watch them fall*

*They stand in the way of love*

*And we will smoke them all*
