I am a PhD student in machine learning and computer vision at the [divison of Robotics, Perception, and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/) 
at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 

My research project is on developing computer vision methods for assisting visually impaired people and is funded by [Stiftelsen Promobilia](https://www.promobilia.se/). 
Mainly, I have been interested in data-efficient methods for image classification, where I am currently focusing on continual learning.<br><br>


#### **News**

* **2023-02-01.** I have relocated to Helsinki in Finland and started working as a postdoc at Aalto University supervised by 
Prof. [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/) and 
Prof. [Juho Kannala](https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/).  

* **2022-11-08.** I have passed my thesis defense and obtained my PhD degree! Special thanks to my opponent Prof. Davide Bacciu; my grading committee members Prof. Serge Belongie, Prof. Per-Erik Forssén, and Prof. Nataša Sladoje; my chairperson Danica Kragic and my supervisors Prof. Hedvig Kjellström and Dr. Cheng Zhang.

**Summary of PhD research:**
*My PhD research has been on developing computer vision methods for assisting people with visual impairment. 
Early on, my research focused on the study of image classification for visual assistance when grocery shopping using a mobile phone. 
Here, we applied a variational autoencoder for fusing mobile phone images together with web-scraped images and text descriptions of groceries to train more accurate classifiers, compared to training with mobile phone images only. 
More recently, I have worked with replay-based continual learning motivated by mitigating catastrophic forgetting of image classifiers in user personalization scenarios. 
Our focus has been on showing the benefits of scheduling which tasks to replay at different time intervals, which is necessary in scenarios where the number of tasks exceeds the replay memory size. 
Currently, we are aiming to use reinforcement learning for learning replay scheduling policies that can generalize better than replaying all seen tasks equally.*
