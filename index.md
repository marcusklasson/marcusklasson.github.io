I am a PhD student in machine learning and computer vision at the divison of Robotics, Perception, and Learning (RPL) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 

My research project is on developing computer vision methods for assisting visually impaired people and is funded by Stiftelsen Promobilia. 
Currently, I am working with continual learning where the goal is to adapt neural networks to new incoming classes while retaining knolwedge about learned classes in the past.
